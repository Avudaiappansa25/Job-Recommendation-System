# Job Recommendation System - A Personalized Career Solution

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform topic modeling on job descriptions. The resulting topic model can then be used to recommend job postings based on a user's resume or other job-related text.


# Dependencies
This code relies on the following Python packages:

pandas

scikit-learn

nltk

numpy

pickle

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk numpy pickle
# Preparing your data
The code expects job descriptions to be stored in a CSV file with the following format:

Job Description,keyword
The Job Description column should contain the text of the job description, while the keyword column should contain a keyword or label associated with the job (e.g., "data scientist").

# Generating a topic model
To generate a topic model, simply run the process_data() function. This function reads in your job description data, performs text preprocessing (tokenization and stemming), and then applies a truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) topic modeling algorithm.

The process_data() function returns a pandas DataFrame containing the document-topic matrix, which can be used to recommend jobs based on a user's resume. The function also saves the vectorizer and topic model to disk using the pickle module.

# Recommending jobs
To recommend jobs based on a user's resume or other job-related text, you must first preprocess the text using the same tokenization and stemming techniques used to preprocess the job descriptions. Then, you can apply the vectorizer and topic model to the preprocessed text to obtain a topic distribution.

The job_recommender.py script provides an example of how to load the vectorizer and topic model from disk and use them to recommend jobs based on a user's resume. Simply replace the resume variable with your own resume text and run the script to obtain a list of recommended jobs.

# Conclusion
This README file provides an overview of the job recommender topic modeling project and instructions on how to use the code. With a little bit of preparation and some text preprocessing, you can use this code to generate a topic model of job descriptions and recommend jobs based on a user's resume.
